The java.util library has a reasonably complete set of container classes to solve this
problem, the basic types of which are List, Set, Queue, and Map. These types of objects are
also known as collection classes, but because the Java library uses the name Collection to
refer to a particular subset of the library, I shall use the more inclusive term "container."
Containers provide sophisticated ways to hold your objects, and you can solve a surprising
number of problems by using these tools.
